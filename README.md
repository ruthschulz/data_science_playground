This repository is a collection of data science related projects for me to try out different techniques.

- Dog Breed Classifier using Stanford Dogs Dataset (Transfer learning with ResNet50 using keras)
- Food Classifier using Food-101 (Transfer learning with ResNet50 using pytorch)
- Food Classifier using Food-101 (Transfer learning with ResNet50 using fastai)
- Building Classifier using Google Images (Transfer learning with ResNet34 using fastai)
- Twitter US Airlines Sentiment classifier (Transfer learning with fastai's ULMFiT)
