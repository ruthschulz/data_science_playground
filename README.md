This repository is a collection of data science related projects for me to try out different techniques.

- Dog Breed Classifier using Stanford Dogs Dataset (Transfer learning with ResNet50 using keras)
- Food Classifier using Food-101 (Transfer learning with ResNet50 using pytorch)
- Food Classifier using Food-101 (Transfer learning with ResNet50 using fastai)
